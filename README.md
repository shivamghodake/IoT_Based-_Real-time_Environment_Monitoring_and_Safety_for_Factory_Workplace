**Introduction**
- Factories and industries often overlook significant health concerns faced by employees working in challenging environments.
- Lack of attention to these issues results in negative health effects and compromises the well-being of workers.
- The aim of the project is to develop a system that records these effects, aiming to enhance workplace conditions and improve the lives of workers.

**Problem Statement**
- Global industrial growth raises health and environmental concerns and compromises eco-workspaces among workers.

**Objectives**
- To ensure consistent and uninterrupted data transmission.
- To create an accessible web interface for real-time monitoring with security.
- To enable immediate gas leakage detection and mail alert.
- To implement a fire detection mechanism using IoT sensors and send instant email alerts.

**Tools and Technologies**
- Node MCU (esp8266) - To control the entire  monitoring system
- DHT11 sensor - Temperature and humidity sensor
- MQ135 sensor - Detecting gases like Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
- MQ2 Gas sensor - Detects flammable gases
- IR sensor - Flame detector
- Arduino IDE
- HTML/CSS
- Thingspeak
- SMTP Mail Server
  
**Result and Disscussion**
- System feature real-time data enhancing the problem solving.
- System's data prevent fines and ensure worker health.
- The system optimizes work conditions, increasing productivity.
- Capable to send real-time fire and gas alert on Email.
